                        Entity Bean" is a type of Enterprise JavaBean, a server-side Java EE component,
                         that represents persistent data maintained in a database
                         
 @Table Annotation:-------The @Table annotation allows you to specify the details of the table that will be used to persist
                          the entity in the database.The @Table annotation provides four attributes, allowing you to override
                          the name of the table, its catalogue, and its schema, and enforce unique constraints on columns 
                          in the table.For now, we are using just table name, which is EMPLOYEE.
                          
 @Id and @GeneratedValue Annotations:---Each entity bean will have a primary key, which you annotate on the class with the
                                          @Id annotation. 
                                         The primary key can be a single field or a combination of multiple fields depending
                                         on your table structure.
                                         
@Column Annotation

You can use column annotation with the following most commonly used attributes âˆ’

    name attribute permits the name of the column to be explicitly specified.

    length attribute permits the size of the column used to map a value particularly for a String value.
